# Chick-fil-A Inventory and Sales Automation Project:
This project automates inventory and sales data processing for Chick-fil-A, streamlining operations by converting truck order PDFs into Excel spreadsheets and aggregating data for trend analysis. I can't display actual results due to data privacy of current employer. However, I can say that this project has been helpful for my Executive Director in providing tools for waste reduction, cost optimization, and decision-making support using Python. Ultimately resulting in *reduced* profit loss. Everything written is done by myself you can reach me at riverpengelly@gmail.com or find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riverpengelly/)
